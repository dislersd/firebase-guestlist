# firebase-guestlist
Starter code for EverLive's Firebase workshop

## Getting Started

To begin, clone this directory onto your computer.

`git clone https://github.com/mttaggart/firebase-guestlist`

And then change to that directory.

`cd firebase-guestlist`

If you haven't already, you'll need to install the Firebase CLI tools to interact with your Firebase project from the command line.

`yarn global add firebase-tools`

or

`npm install -g firebase-tools`

Also, make sure you've created a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

With the CLI tools installed, we'll need to log in to our Firebase account.

`firebase login`

With that accomplished, we can then init a new project in the current directory.

`firebase init`
